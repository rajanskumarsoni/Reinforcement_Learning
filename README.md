    * Implementation of epsilon-greedy and related plots.
    * Implementation of soft-max algorithm and related plots.
    * Implementation of UCB1 algorithm and comparing with epsilon-greedy and soft-maxand related plots.
    * Implementation  of  Median  algorithm  and  comparing  with epsilon-greedy,  soft-maxand UCB1 and related plots.
    * Comparison of the above four algorithm as the number of arm grows.
